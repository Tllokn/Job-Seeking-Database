# Job-Seeking-Database
This is a job seek database which contains the ER diagram, Navicate-SQLite database, fakedata creation and HTML website display.

see more details in the README.pdf

For this database we basically create a diagram which can record the process of a company hiring process. 
First of all we can create different jobs for different departments according to company command, including where to work and how much salary we supply.
Then we can decide how many and which HRs will handle a specific application.
At last, we can arrange different interviews for different applicants, and record the interview result.
This is a very practical system and it do include enough schemas.

We can think about some specific situations:
Such as:

1. We want to know how many people apply for SDE jobs in iOS departments. We should search "apply" and Jobs(category) jointly.
2. We want to find how many interview a SDE job need, we can search the interview schema.

3. We want to find how many applicants were interviewed by Interviewer "001", we need to search "join" and "arrange" jointly.

I think this will be a fun and practical system.
